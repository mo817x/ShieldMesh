# ShieldMesh‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Symbolic Cyber Defense for Ethereum

> **Developed under Mo817 Sovereign Intelligence Architecture**

ShieldMesh‚Ñ¢ is a multi-layer symbolic defense framework designed to protect smart contracts not only at the code level, but at the level of meaning, time, and behavioral integrity.

## üî∞ Key Concepts

- **7 Symbolic Defense Layers**: Codex Seal, ChronoFlux‚Ñ¢, Mimicry Detection, Echo Divergence, Input Purity, Meaning Integrity, and InfinityWipe‚Ñ¢.
- **Protects Against**: Cloning, semantic theft, time-based exploits, behavioral mimicry, and post-deployment semantic drift.
- **Architecture Origin**: Mo817 Cyber Sovereignty Layer.

## üß† Core Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `whitepaper.pdf` | Full symbolic whitepaper outlining the 7-layer defense system |
| `evaluation.pdf` | Independent strategic evaluation of feasibility and value |
| `prototype/` | Early prototypes of core modules (coming soon) |

## üöÄ Roadmap

1. Build initial prototype with 3 core layers
2. Integrate with Dune monitoring dashboard
3. Publish symbolic registry via Codex Wall‚Ñ¢
4. Submit EIP proposal for Ethereum-wide integration
